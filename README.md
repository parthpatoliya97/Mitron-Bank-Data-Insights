# Mitron Bank Credit Card Launch Strategy
## Problem Statement :-
- Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. 

- AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details.
